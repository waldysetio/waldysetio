I am a fresh graduate with strong foundational knowledge in software engineering and machine learning. I have gained experience in creating end-to-end data science projects to solve some business problems through virtual internships, online courses, and final project in college. As an intellectually curious person who is comfortable working independently and collaboratively, I am always eager to learn and keep abreast of state-of-the-art technology in data science and beyond.

Some of the projects that I have built are:
1. Churn modeling using Extreme Gradient Boosting based on more than 193.000 rows of customers' activity and price history data to predict customers' propensity to churn and understand what factors that contribute to the churn. 
2. Credit risk analysis using Logistic Regression to predict prospective borrowers' probability to default based on previous customers' credit history. 
3. Movie recommendation system using model-based collaborative filtering based on over 100.000 ratings applied to more than 9.000 movies. 
4. Price estimation of property rent in Paris based on more than 50.000 properties' prices and their specifications. 
5. Web scraper and Telegram Bot to parse earthquake data from BMKG website and send the latest earthquake information to telegram app automatically. 

My proficiencies are (but not limited to):
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Machine Learning
- SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Git/Version Control, Google Cloud Platform, Flask, Django
- Data Science Workflow (Data Preparation, Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Machine Learning Modeling, Deployment, and Evaluation).
